Ah, mornings.  For some of us, the sound of an alarm clock signals brewing coffee, a plant-powered breakfast, and the start of another day. For others, it means groaning, hitting snooze, and hoping the line at our local won’t be too long when we rush in for a long black and whatever can be eaten on the go. 

But how we start our day can set the tone for the rest of it, prepping us to be more productive, confident, positive — and closer to reaching our goals. Luckily, being a “morning person” isn’t a matter of good genetics, but habit. Developing a relaxing, fulfilling morning routine can be one of the keys to making some serious inroads on your to-do list. We found some of the best morning advice from some of our favourite ladies to help you develop your new routine.

**Gwyneth Paltrow**
Sure, Goop might have some more unusual suggestions, but we can’t help but be impressed by everything Gwyneth has accomplished. The actress and cookbook author starts her day with warm water with lemon and time with her family. She makes sure to appreciate her mornings with her kids, reading to them and dropping them off at school after breakfast. Of course, if you really want to channel the Oscar winner, you’ll have to hit the gym for two hours every day.

**Arianna Huffington**
The co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post might be busy running the world, but she starts the day by not immediately connecting to it. She leaves checking emails and smartphone for later, instead spending the early hours setting intentions for herself and practicing yoga. 

**Anna Wintour**
Anna Wintour has the sort of morning routine we’d expect from the editor-in-chief of Vogue and artistic director of Conde Nast. A wake-up time of 5:45 means that she has plenty of time to play tennis for an hour and return home to freshen up before reigning over the world of fashion.

**Lauren Conrad**
Like most morning people, L.C. is all about setting your alarm to have plenty of time before you head to work. She suggests heading to bed around 10 PM so that you’ll be refreshed at 6 AM ,and spending the first few minutes tidying up, from making your bed (nothing feels better after a long day than a freshly made bed!) to washing your face. She is also known to spend 20 minutes oil pulling, an ancient practice of swishing coconut oil in your mouth to eliminate toxins and bad bacteria. After a good workout, Lauren recommends rocking out to your favourite tunes while preparing a supercharged breakfast. 

**Miranda Kerr**
The supermodel gets her glow from doing one simple thing every day: a morning begun with dry brushing. Dry brushing is a powerful exfoliator, removing dead skin cells while stimulating new cell renewal. It also helps improve blood circulation, your immune system, and your lymphatic system. Bonus: it has been tied to reducing cellulite.
