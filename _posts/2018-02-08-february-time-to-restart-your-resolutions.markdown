We’ve got one month of 2018 under our belts, which means it’s time to look back at the resolutions we set for ourselves in January. Whether that was to exercise on a regular basis, smile more, or consume a healthier diet, we know that it can be easy to forget these goals in favor of what’s convenient and familiar. That’s why we think February is the perfect opportunity to press reset, revisit our resolutions, and take fresh steps to realize them. 

Here are some of our fave methods of bringing new life to our resolutions and making 2018 our best year yet. 


**Make It Monthly**
Developing new practices and habits takes time, and sometimes big overhauls can seem so daunting, we forego giving them a shot. Set monthly themes, like making sure you’re meeting your water requirements in March, or trying to reduce food waste in April. Eventually, these will become second nature and you’ll be doing them on autopilot. 

**Start Small**
Like we said, integrating healthier behaviour isn’t a “go big or go home” situation. Even just committing to a five-minute morning meditation once every few days or making a hot water with lemon before breakfast will help you develop nourishing regimens without requiring too much time.

**Create an Accountability System**
Remove the temptation of cheating on your resolution by developing a system that will keep you on track. Whether or not you two have the same goals, pick a friend you can check in with — and who can check in with you — once a week and keep them updated on your progress. Not only will it provide you with someone to remind you to drink more water or chow down on more veggies, you’ll also have a chance to humble-brag. Writing down your progress can also be a great way to stay accountable, and have a written account of your progress.

**Keep It Positive**
Implementing healthier changes runs the risk of surrounding yourself with negative language: what you can’t eat, what you’re eliminating from your diet, what you’re sacrificing. Instead, think of all those delicious, plant-powered dishes you’re adding. Making these shifts shouldn’t be about restrictions, but about taking a proactive approach to your health and trying tasty, super-charged meals that you might not otherwise discover.   

**Remember Why**
It’s one thing to say you want to meal prep on the weekends, be more productive, or adopt a plant-based diet. It’s another thing to stick to it if you don’t know why you made that resolution in the first place. Evaluate why it’s important to you. How is it going to benefit you emotionally, physically, socially, or financially? If you can’t come up with a strong answer, it might be time to rethink your goal and tailor one to your needs and wishes. And don’t worry — it’s never too late to jump into new resolutions and build a more nourishing, positive, and rewarding life.
