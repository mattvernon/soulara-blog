Sometimes, we all want life to be a little easier. It may not be a quick fix, but the answer to many health complaints can often begin with a simple solution: our diet. Chronic inflammation within our bodies is tied to a variety of issues, ranging from joint pain to gum health to diabetes, and an anti-inflammatory diet can help address, and even reverse, some of these diseases.

So what does this diet look like? Primarily, avoid refined carbohydrates, refined sugars, and processed foods, and when indulging, limit yourself to moderate amounts of dark chocolate and red wine. Here are some of the best options to put on your plate to keep your body healthy and strong.

**1. Green Leafy Vegetables**
It’s possible there isn’t any problem kale can’t solve. Leafy greens, like chard, broccoli, and kale, are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory flavonoids. They boast high levels of vitamin K, which can help strengthen bones and help the brain avoid oxidative stress, and vitamin C, which helps iron absorption. 

**2. Turmeric**
Right now, it’s hard to go into a café and not find someone drinking a turmeric latte. That’s because the vibrant yellow spice is a true superfood thanks to curcumin, a naturally occurring chemical compound that is known to fight chronic inflammation. Taking turmeric daily has also been found to help with conditions ranging from depression to candida to lupus to viral infections. To enhance the curcumin’s effectiveness, add black pepper to your turmeric recipe of choice.

**3. Beets**
Beets’ stunning color is due to betalain, an antioxidant that helps reduce inflammation in the body by reducing the production of inflammation-producing enzymes. The root vegetables also contain fiber, folate, and manganese, and can help protect against cancer and heart disease. 

**4. Berries**
You don’t have to convince us to eat more berries. These little powerhouses — especially raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries — are loaded with antioxidants, the same flavonoids found in leafy greens. Getting high doses of flavonoids helps your body defend against free-radical damage to cells, which will reduce inflammation. Among their numerous other health benefits, berries have also been found to reduce cognitive decline and protect against cancer. 

**5. Cinnamon**
A perfect way to sweeten a dish or almond milk latte without sugar, cinnamon contains high levels of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds that can help our body heal, combatting infections and repairing damaged tissue. It can also help reduce and regulate blood sugar, which could, in turn, reduce inflammation. 

**6. Chia Seeds**
Omega-3 fatty acids are a great way to reduce inflammation, and chia seeds are loaded with them, along with fiber and protein. Easy to add to snacks, beverages, or full meals, chia seeds also help support brain and heart health and can help mediate high cholesterol.

**7. Ginger**
Delicious in cooking, invaluable to your body. Ginger, which can ease digestive discomfort, impedes the production of cytokines, or proteins released by immune cells that trigger inflammation. Much of the anti-inflammatory abilities are due to a substance called gingerol, which also has antioxidant properties. Consuming ginger has also been found to reduce pain and new research suggests it may help lower blood sugar.
