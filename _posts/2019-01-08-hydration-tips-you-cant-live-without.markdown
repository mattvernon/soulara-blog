Dragging your feet behind you through the heatwave? You might not be giving your body the hydration it needs.

Adequate hydration is so important. Without it, your energy and concentration levels drop. You can feel moody, headache-y and irritable.

Water is also essential for transporting nutrients from the food you eat to the cells they need to go in the body. It’s also required for toxin elimination - which is why constipation can be a side effect of a poor water intake.

Feel like you could be do a better job at keeping your hydration levels in check? Here are six simple suggestions you might not have thought of.

**Eat more plants**

It’s easy to forget that fresh produce is PACKED with H20 - so you can eat or drink your fruit and veggies and hydrate too.

Plant foods with an especially high water content include:

* Zucchini: 94% water

* Celery: 95% water

* Tomatoes: 94% water

* Cauliflower: 92% water

Cold pressed juice is another effective (and delicious) way to rehydrate, all while giving you a variety of vitamins and minerals to keep your energy levels up in the heat. [Check out the range of Cold Pressed Juices on our Menu.](https://www.soulara.com.au/)

**Take a peek at your pee**

It can be a great indicator of your hydration levels. Dark yellow means you need to chug more water, whereas a near-clear coloured urine is a good sign that you’re sorted in the hydration department.

**Cut Back On Coffee**

And caffeinated tea. They are both diuretics, meaning they up the amount of water and salt excreted from the body through the urine (which explains that post-coffee pee). We’re not saying you have to give up your morning cuppa or almond milk latte, but rather to be mindful of the amount of diuretics you’re consuming, especially while it’s scorching out.

**Pro-tip:** chase every cup of tea or coffee with a glass of water to help counteract its diuretic effect.

**Have more alcohol-free days**

Yet another reason to cut back on booze: alcohol is not only a toxin, it’s a diuretic. Swap your champas (or second glass of it) for one of our house-made, health-promoting Kombuchas and you won’t even feel like you’re missing out.

**Listen to your body**

Don’t ignore those thirst signals! If you’re feeling parched, always choose water. And remember that thirst is often mistaken for hunger, so if you’ve got a grumbling tummy but only had breakkie an hour ago, fill up that water bottle!

**Keep your water bottle handy**

Be it on your desk if you work in an office space, or in your canvas bag if you’re always on the go - a reminder for you to drink up and to keep track of your H20 intake.

Invest in a pretty or funky reusable water bottle so that you’re taking care of the environment at the same time, and not absorbing anything weird from all the plastic.
