We’re super thrilled to announce that we’ve recently [debuted our own line of cold pressed juices](https://www.soulara.com.au/on-the-menu). After many years of being fans of other brands, we thought it was time we started making our own so we’d know exactly where our fruits and veg were coming from. It doesn’t hurt that now we know the final product is as natural and nutritious as it can be.

We’ve spent a lot of time, energy, and brainstorming (and taste-testing) sessions to determine the best juices we could make, both in terms of flavor and nourishment. Our mission is to provide you with food that makes you feel better on both the outside and the inside — and our juices are designed to do just that. Here’s a breakdown of how we choose some of the produce we work with, and why each one is so powerful.  

**Kale**
The leafy green is found in our **Oh Kale Yeah** juice, delivering a burst of vibrant color and a wealth of nutrients. It’s packed with Vitamins A, K, C, and B6, along with essential minerals like manganese, calcium, and potassium. You’ll also find powerful antioxidants including quercetin and kaempferol. As foreign as those names might sound, their functions are familiar: they can help reduce the damage done by free radicals while lowering cholesterol for better heart health. They also help combat everything from cancer to depression, and fight inflammation, which has been linked to physical and mental diseases. 

**Mint**
We’re serious about our herbs. Mint, which makes an appearance in our **You’re One in a Melon** juice, is one of your gut’s best friends. It can be used to help aid with digestion and ease any stomach discomfort, and has been found to be a safe treatment for IBS. The rosmarinic acid within the plants can help protect you against seasonal allergies, while menthol acts as a natural decongestant to help you fight the common cold. It’s just a bonus that it naturally freshens your breath — no mouthwash required.

**Apple**
Apples are a staple in cold pressed juices for a reason. They are loaded with phytonutrients, minerals (like potassium and manganese), and vitamins (like Vitamin C and Vitamin K) while being low in sugar. They also contain polyphenols, or compounds that are known to fight diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Pectin, a type of fiber found within apples, is a prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria within your gut, which helps with digestion, weight management, and overall health. 

**Ginger**
Dear ginger: we just can’t get enough of you. The root, relied upon for centuries for its medicinal properties, is rich with bioactive compounds like gingerol, which is known for its ability to reduce inflammation. What do you get from these anti-inflammatory properties? Everything from reduced muscle pain after a day of intense exercise to relief from osteoarthritis. Among its numerous other benefits, ginger can help reduce stomach discomfort, enhance brain function, and even bolster the immune system. 

**Carrots**
Sneaking carrots into a cold pressed juice adds a natural sweetness, and plenty of compounds that your body needs. Along with vitamins, you’ll find pantothenic acid (which helps convert food to energy), folate, potassium, and iron, among other minerals. Carrots can help both improve eyesight and protect against eye disease, as well as assist in regulating blood sugar and reduce the risk of cancer.
