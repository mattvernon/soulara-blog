**Keep it simple:**

It’s time to take control of your gut health. When looking to supercharge your gut, it’s so important to be simple with it. By taking one easy step at a time, and
not stressing about being perfect, you can be on your way to looking after the most influential part of your body.

**Give your digestive system a break:**

One of the first ways to look after your gut is to give it some time to rest. As a result of instant and processed foods and chemically driven choices, our digestive systems wind up over–burdened and confused. By consuming slow-cooked and cooked foods like soups, curries, and adding healing spices such as turmeric and ginger, your body will allow itself the time it needs to rest and digest whilst still healing and sealing the lining of the gut so you can absorb more nutrients from your food. Using veggie broths as a base to meals means you can enjoy key minerals and ingredients which are just as nourishing for your insides as they are for your outsides.

**Prebiotic foods you should eat:**

Root vegetables, like parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes are naturally gluten-free, rich in prebiotic fibre and provide a whole load of nutrients. Plus, they have a low glycaemic index which means they won’t induce inflammation or digestive issues. I love roasting root veggies in the oven and using them to make thicker and heartier soups. The prebiotic fibres in these vegetables help to maintain a healthy community of bacteria in the gut and can ease digestion. Garlic is another wonder-food that can help combat sickness, high blood pressure and gut issues. Garlic can help detoxify the body from heavy metals too. I mean, if you’re looking for an excuse to eat garlic bread, this is it. Just replace white bread from the supermarket with a piece of my Golden Gut Pumpkin and Nut Loaf.

**Stay hydrated:**

Getting enough fluids is another easy way to look after your gut health. The simple technique of drinking water and herbal tea helps to flush out bad bacteria
within the gut and can bring balance and flow back into the digestive system. This will keep your gut happy and functioning at its prime.  Including more ginger, in your diet is a powerful ally for supercharging your gut and contains additional anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial compounds which block inflammation-producing genes, keeping your tummy happy, healthy and inflammation-free.

**Cut back on sugar:**

Sugar can feed the bad bacteria in the microbiome and also is inflammatory to the body.  Cutting down on processed white sugar can improve your gut health. Sugar is also connected to hormones and one of the simple ways to support gut hormones is to avoid a processed food diet with an excess of sugar and refined carbohydrates.

**Eat fermented foods for a healthy gut:**

Probiotic-rich foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi and cultured vegetables are going to help our inner-plants flourish and grow and prebiotics are the foods that act as a fertiliser to help feed, fuel and nourish probiotics. Prebiotics play a major role in promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut and are incredibly important in helping protect and rebuild within the intestinal walls. Foods rich in prebiotic fiber include jicama (Mexican yam), dandelion greens, asparagus, onions, garlic, chicory root, cashews, pistachios, lentils, kidney beans, and Jerusalem artichoke.
