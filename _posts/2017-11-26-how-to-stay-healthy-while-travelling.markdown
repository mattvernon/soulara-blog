Calling all wanderers, explorers, and sightseers. We can’t pick the best part of hitting the road: tasting new foods, finding the perfect Instagram shot, or discovering new cultures, but without proper care, travelling can wear down your body. Feeling tired or on the verge of a cold can seriously mess with those vacation vibes, so we’ve put together some of our favourite tricks to boost your immune system and energy. With a little self-care, staying healthy will be easier than picking a place for dinner.

**Get some Z’s** 
You knew this was coming. Sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your body when you’re at home, but it’s especially critical when you’re in an exotic destination. Travel, carrying luggage, and walking around a new city is draining, so give yourself time to refresh and rejuvenate. It might be tempting to power through in order to see as much as possible, but you won’t be able to appreciate it if you’re groggy or fatigued. 

**Get some exercise**
Luckily, this usually happens on holidays by default. Maintaining an exercise regimen will help boost your energy and immune system. Either take advantage of public gyms or workout facilities in your hotel, or just make sure you’re walking as much as possible. Plus, viewing the city by foot will help you appreciate it in a way you couldn’t by taxi or bus. 

**Pack your own snacks…**
While it can be helpful to have your go-to healthy snacks on hand to fight off hunger pangs while touring a new place, snacks especially helpful during the actual travel. Think layovers and flight delays: the food you’ll find in airports will be overpriced, and probably not very nutritious. Plan your snacks ahead of time so you and your family and friends have something to much on while you’re waiting. You’ll save money and you’ll feel more recharged after fresh fruit or home-made trail mix than after a bland airport pastry. 

**…and don’t overeat**
We know — part of the joys of traveling is discovering the local cuisine. That’s why we recommend practicing hara hachi bu, the Confucian practice of eating only until you’re 80 percent full. You’ll feel better, maintain a healthier weight, and not feel like you’re heading towards a food coma after every meal. By eating in moderation, you’ll be able to fully enjoy more food throughout the course of your trip. Bonus: that means you’ll be able to take the rest back as leftovers. 

**Don’t leave your vitamins at home**
Your diet probably isn’t going to be perfect — nor should it be (we can’t expect ourselves to go to Paris and not make full use of the boulangeries, after all.) Since your meals might not be as nutrient-packed as usual, make sure you’re getting all essential vitamins by bringing supplements with you.
