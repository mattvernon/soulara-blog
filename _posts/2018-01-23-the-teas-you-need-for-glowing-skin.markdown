There’s nothing as versatile as tea when it comes to being the perfect remedy for any situation, whether you need comforting when sick, something to relax you after a long day, or a quick boost of energy? With amino acids, vitamins, and catechins (a type of natural antioxidant), tea’s myriad of benefits include contributing to a radiant complexion. Containing nutrients that stimulate collagen production and maintain healthy skin cells, tea can be a powerful (and delicious) addition to your skincare regime. Here are some of our go-to teas when our skin needs a little TLC. 

**Rooibos**
Rooibos boasts an antioxidant arsenal, one powerful enough to prevent and reverse fat loss underneath the skin. Worried about wrinkles or wanting to channel a more youthful glow? Superoxide dismutase, an enzyme, helps produce new skin cells and ward off free radicals that can cause fine lines. Thanks to flavonoids, regularly drinking rooibos tea can also lead to a reduction in eczema and acne.

**Dandelion**
One man’s weed is another man’s miracle plant. Dandelion tea is one of our personal favourites — it has a deep, rich flavour and makes an addictive latte when combined with coconut milk. Full of antioxidants, it’s another staple that wants your skin to live its best life. It’s also well-known for helping with liver detox, critical since a polluted liver can lead to psoriasis, acne, rashes, and premature aging, among other nasty symptoms. Get even more dandelion in your life by sprinkling it onto salads or blending it in smoothies.

**Hibiscus**
Refreshing and vibrant, hibiscus tea helps contribute to a natural glow thanks to the presence of vitamins C, A, B1, B2, and zinc. Perhaps most importantly, it contains alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), which will exfoliate, unclog pores, and moisturize and firm your skin. Hibiscus also contains fatty acids, which your hair and nails will thank you for. Bonus that the tart flavor is a great pick-me-up during a hot summer day. 

**Matcha**
Matcha lattes are cropping up everywhere, and for good reason. Along with antioxidants, the green drink contains catechin, which will protect against bacterial infections, and chlorophyll, which can help your body protect remove toxins and free radicals. Matcha also has antibiotic properties, supporting your body as it heals itself internally and externally. These offer a natural, gentle way to reduce acne and protect against acne-causing bacteria. 

**Peppermint**
Not just for soothing stomachs, peppermint is good if you’re trying to combat oily skin and acne. The tea contains menthol, which will reduce oil secretion. Less oil means fewer irritants like dust and dirt can stick to the skin, reducing the risk of pimples. It can also help fight hormonal acne by boosting oestrogen levels, one of the culprits behind breakouts. For the full benefit, let a tea bag steep for 10 minutes in hot water. After cooling it in the fridge, use it as a toner after washing your face at night.
