It would be nice if the simplest cures were the ones that worked — and sometimes they are. But when it comes to dark circles and puffy eyes, getting your eight hours of Z’s don’t necessarily ward them off. Luckily, we can always turn to eye cream and concealer, but there’s nothing as frustrating as waking up looking like we pulled an all-nighter even if we curled under the covers at 10 PM. While we love finding new tricks and hacks to banish them, knowing the causes is just as important as treating the symptoms. While lack of sleep and excess salt are major perpetrators of puffy eyes, there are a host of other factors.

Thin skin: Facial skin is some of the thinnest on our bodies and under constant exertion, making it the most susceptible to showing signs of aging and stress. The skin under our eyes is the thinnest and most fragile, meaning that the years are going to reveal themselves there first and blue blood vessels are more apparent. Don’t underestimate the importance of a good skin cream, which can thicken the skin and boost collagen production to also help combat fine lines and wrinkles. You can also integrate foods high in healthy fat to help support your skin’s moisture: think avocado, nuts, and seeds.  

Sleep smarter: Your sleeping posture can cause fluid to build up underneath your eyes, or gravity can pull a cruel joke and weaken the skin’s elasticity. Avoid sleeping on your stomach and prop your head up with pillows to channel gravity’s powers for good. To go one step further, treat yourself to a silk pillowcase, which will rub less against your skin to reduce wrinkles. Your hair will thank you, too.

Prioritise your health: By now, you know that what we put into our bodies has a direct impact on how they feel (and look). For a rejuvenated glow, make sure you’re getting sufficient amounts of water and limited caffeine and alcohol, which can take a serious toll on our skin. High-sodium and high-sugar diets can cause puffy eyes thanks to water retention and inflammation, respectively. Of course, stay away from cigarettes. Along with its many other health concerns, smoking can leach collagen at a rapid rate, exacerbating the appearance of tired eyes. 

Fight allergies: Your dark circles might not have anything to do with a late night or having one too many glasses of wine. Instead, blame the season. Allergies lead to our bodies producing histamines, chemicals that try to help our bodies rid irritating substances and cause blood vessels to dilate in the process. Given how thin under-eye skin is, this can make it look darker than it should. Try taking some anti-allergy meds, or try a natural remedy like local raw honey, apple cider vinegar, or switching to a more anti-inflammatory diet.
