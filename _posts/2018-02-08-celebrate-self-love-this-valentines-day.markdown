For a holiday that’s all about love, it can arouse some non-fuzzy feelings. With 14 February fast approaching comes the season of roses, chocolates, and heart-shaped everything — and you’re most likely either anticipating a day of romance, or dreading it. But whether you’re cuddling up with an SO or flying solo this year, Valentine’s Day should be an opportunity to show a very special person some serious love: yourself. 

Practicing self-care is an essential component to a healthy lifestyle, but in day-to-day life, it can be tempting to push workouts — or even just unwinding — to the sidelines. Recharge, relax, and rejuvenate this Valentine’s Day by making time for self-love (and maybe a few chocolates). 

Get Your Sweat On
Awaken your inner warrior with workouts that will deliver benefits far beyond just justifying a big dinner. For something more soothing, unroll your yoga mat in your living room or local studio and go through a refreshing, strengthening flow. To get your blood pumping, try a kickboxing class, which will tone, energize, and seriously boost your confidence. Even a calm, meditative walk through a nearby park is a great opportunity to connect with your body and disconnect from your to-do list.

Write Love Letters…To Yourself
It’s easy to constantly focus on what we want to improve about ourselves, but at Soulara, we think it’s more important to focus on what we love. Write yourself a letter about your strengths, gifts, achievements, and goals while showing yourself forgiveness, compassion, and acceptance.    

Take Yourself On a Date
SO out of town? Friends too busy for a Galentines dinner? Loving the single life? There are plenty of reasons why you should be scheduling a date with yourself — trust us: even if you’re not sold yet, it may be one of the best dates you go on. Treat yourself to a dinner at your fave restaurant or the new place you’ve been dying to try, or finally catch that movie you keep talking about going to see. You deserve it.

Spoil Yourself
Like we said, you deserve it. But we don’t just mean buying that bracelet you’ve been eyeing or springing for an extravagant degustation menu. Remember what excites you, and devote part of your day or evening to it. Maybe it’s perusing cookbooks and blogs for creative new recipes, curling up with a novel, or planning your next overseas trip; whatever it is, remember that making time for that will make you feel happier and more motivated in the long run. 

Hang Out At Home
Let’s be honest: we all have a soft spot for our couches, pajamas, and Netflix, so it only makes sense that they’re included in the perfect Valentine’s Day plans. Cook yourself that dinner you’ve had bookmarked (or break into your favourite Soulara meal — we hear our truffle potato and kale cakes taste even better on February 14), treat yourself to your favourite wine, kombucha, or tea, and get comfy for a long, uninterrupted night of your go-to show. 

At Soulara, we’re all about self-love with meals designed to be as nutritious as they are delicious. Delivered straight to your door, our dishes will help you feel happy, healthy, sexy, and strong.
