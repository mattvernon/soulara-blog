It’s 12 AM, and you’re still awake, fidgeting, staring at the ceiling, waiting for that elusive slumber. You’re not alone. The Sleep Health Foundation estimates that 1.5 million, or nine percent, of Australians suffer from sleep disorders, with 1 in 3 struggling with sleep-related issues. Insomnia, and the morning after, can be frustrating — and even debilitating —, but making a few lifestyle changes can help end those sleepless nights. 

Here are some of our favourite ways to beat insomnia and help get the perfect night’s rest.

**Create a schedule**
We know how crazy life can get, and, sometimes, nights can get away from us, whether because of a Stranger Things binge, catching up with lost friends, or hurrying to finish something for work. However, your body likes routine and we know you like your body, so show it some love by keeping to a strict schedule. By hitting the sack at the same time every day, you’ll be able to more easily fall asleep, and more easily wake up. 

Struggling to create one? Make incremental changes at first, perhaps aiming for 11:30 PM and gradually shifting it earlier as your body acclimates. 

**Block the blue light**
In other words, put your phone down at least 30 minutes before you go to bed, and put it on “Do Not Disturb” so late-night notifications aren’t waking you up. Our devices emit blue light, which suppresses melatonin, a hormone that helps us fall into a deep, quality sleep. Let your brain produce its melatonin in peace by keeping your devices outside of your bedroom, or avoiding them leading up to sleep. 

Psychologically, blue light can also make our brains associate our bedroom to things like work or entertainment, making it more difficult to fall asleep.

**Go for a run**
Or do some yoga. Or lift some weights. Or go for a swim. Whatever your work out of choice, getting exercise not only tires your body out to physically induce sleep at night, but it also raises your body temperature to keep you alert during the day. You’ll be able to accomplish more, and research has found it’s likely to help decrease arousal, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, all of which can impact your sleep. 

**Lose your PJs** 
We probably don’t have to tell you twice as summer approaches, but going PJ-free can be an untraditional track to improving your sleep. Since our bodies both cool down, and required a cooled space, to get proper rest, pajamas can actually impede your quality of ZZZs. Too-tight pajamas can get in the way of your body properly cooling itself — especially in the warmer months.

**Makeover time**
If you’re in the mood for a DIY project, grab a can of paint and freshen up your bedroom. According to The Huffington Post, colours like blue and green can help you feel calm and tranquil, facilitating easier sleep. Plus, it’s the perfect excuse to redecorate.
