It’s about time our guts are getting the attention they deserve. Not just responsible for helping us digest food, our guts are the cornerstones of our overall health, influencing our immune systems, our weight, and even our state of mind. A plethora of scientific research in recent years has linked all manners of physical and emotional maladies to what’s going on in our stomachs, finding that many illnesses can be directly associated to what food we have on our forks. Safe to say, caring for the 100 trillion bacteria living in our intestines is key. We’ve rounded up some of the best ways to start caring for your gut health — trust us. You’ll love how good it makes you feel.

**Plants, plants, and more plants**
Obviously, at Soulara, we’re big on eating plants, but a diet filled with veggies, whole grains, nuts, and seeds is a diet that will care for your gut. Their high fibre content will ensure your intestines stay clean, while a variety of plant-based foods will promote gut bacteria diversity. Bonus: many of them are loaded with prebiotics, which probiotics — a gut’s best friend — need to grow and stay strong.

**Power up with probiotics**
These little critters are literally little critters — live microorganisms, they populate your digestive tract with friendly, healthy bacteria and do all the things we want our health food to do. To summarise their benefits: you can expect stronger immunity, better digestion, and a more glowing complexion. Enticed? Your best natural source of probiotics are fermented foods like coconut milk yogurt, sauerkraut, miso, kimchi, water kefir, and kombucha. You can also consider a probiotic supplement, though make sure you do your research. Generally, ones that require refrigeration are your best bet.

**Meanwhile, hold off on the antibiotics**
Antibiotics have their moments, but many people tend to overestimate how frequent those moments are. While they can be extremely useful when necessary, antibiotics work to treat serious bacterial issues by wiping out all bacteria, even the good guys. Restoring a healthy bacterial balance is much harder than disrupting it, and frequent antibiotic use can lead to issues such as candida, leaky gut, and gut dysbiosis.  

**Lower your inflammation**
Whether you’re just trying to protect or gut or heal it, you’ll want to avoid inflammatory triggers like sugars and processed foods. They can throw off your gut flora’s balance and contribute to autoimmune diseases. Instead, chow down on your plants and integrate soothing, anti-inflammatory items like turmeric, ginger, aloe vera, and slippery elm. These will also help heal the gut barrier if you’re suffering from an intestinal condition. 

**Say no to stress**
A healthy gut will make you feel less stressed, but you need less stress for a healthy gut. Sound like a catch-22? It’s not. Practice yoga, meditation, or just commit to a regular exercise practice to keep everything functioning at its best.
