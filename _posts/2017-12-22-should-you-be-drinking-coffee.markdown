One of our favourite mottos is: “But first, coffee.” For many of us, a morning doesn’t really start until we’re properly caffeinated. But when we grab our mug, most likely, we’re thinking of getting our day started, rather than the potential health benefits. If coffee is part of our daily routine, we need to make sure it’s keeping our wellness goals on track. 

**The bad news**
If you’re starting a new diet or detox, you’ll most likely see coffee make the naughty list, alongside gluten, dairy, sugar, and alcohol. That’s because coffee can spike insulin levels, which pushes glucose into your muscle and fat cells. It can also cause inflammation, leading to breakouts, or put a strain on your immune system. It is very dehydrating, which is a culprit behind premature aging, and can overstimulate our nervous system, putting it into constant fight-or-flight mode. Sounds scary? Don’t worry. The negative consequences are usually due to excessive caffeine consumption. 

**The good news**
None of that means we’re abandoning our long black. Coffee is one of the most antioxidant-rich foods in the world — which are great for our skin and warding off sun damage, essential in these summer months! — as well as protecting against a host of other health concerns. Coffee has been found to be an effective defense against diseases like Type 2 Diabetes, Parkinson’s, and certain types of cancer. So how do you get the  benefits without the downsides? 
* **Moderation is key:** How many times have you heard this on your health journey? We hate to sound like a broken record, but it’s some of the best advice we know. Stick to one cup of coffee a day, and when we say coffee, we mean coffee. Cut out any sugar and consider limiting the use of non-dairy milk. If you’re ever finding it hard to resist that second or third cup, just remember that practicing moderation will allow you to enjoy coffee and feel healthy in the long-term.
* **Drink water:** To compensate for coffee’s dehydrating effect, drink an extra glass of water for each cup you consume. Plus, by being aware of your coffee to water ratio, you might become more conscientious of your water habits in general and make sure you’re meeting your daily quota.
* **Go organic:** Unfortunately, because coffee is universally beloved, it’s heavily sprayed by pesticides. Those toxins mean that your one cup isn’t going to yield any health benefits, so swap to organic beans. They’ll taste better and your body will appreciate the burst of antioxidants. You can also prepare your coffee at home, so you can be sure you’re getting organic, fair-trade beans — nothing says good morning like coffee that’s good for your body and the environment.

Pining for a sweet, creamy latte? Resist the temptation by brewing a super-powered alternative. We love to brew a fresh cup of coffee and put it into the blender with coconut oil, some honey, a splash of unsweetened non-dairy milk, and vanilla extract. It’ll taste indulgent while your brain will thank you for the long-lasting energy boost from the coconut oil.
