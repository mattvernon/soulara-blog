What works for your body in the warmer months might not have the same effect as the temperature drops. Ease into autumn and transition into winter with our tips for supporting your health and wellbeing while it’s chilly out. 

**1. Get back to your roots**

Heartier than your salad vegetables, root vegetables are perfect for filling up on over the colder seasons - while your appetite naturally increases. Not only do they provide warming, fibre-rich carbohydrates to give you slow-burning energy, they’re also abundant in immune-boosting nutrients; carrot, pumpkin, sweet potatoes and surprisingly, potatoes will give you a good dose of vitamin C. Orange root vegetables are also bursting with antioxidant-rich vitamin A.

**2. Salute the sun**

Practising yoga, especially sun salutations in the morning, is a great way to open your airways and alleviate any congestion - all while getting your blood flowing and creating a positive mindset for the day ahead. 

**3. Prioritise rest**

When the days are shorter, it’s only natural that your body feels the need to rest and restore. Listen to your body and give yourself permission to go to bed half an hour or even an hour earlier than you do in summer. You’ll likely find that by doing this, you feel rejuvenated upon waking instead of being tempted to hit snooze.

**4. Cosy up with herbs and spices**

Mother nature knows how to bring the flavour your favourite dishes, and warmth to your body: with herbs and spices! If you always feel cold no matter how warm you dress, try adding cinnamon to your meals: traditionally used to soak up dampness in the body, it also helps to increase circulation...and tastes magical sprinkled on porridge with mashed caramelised banana or grated apple. 

Ginger and cardamom can help warm and soothe a stagnant digestive system, and a generous pinch of cayenne in your curry serves as a natural heater, from the from the inside-out.

**5. Switch to warm water**

Your body might be trying to tell you something when it shivers after an iced glass of water. Ancient Ayurvedic medicine believes that drinking cold drinks in the cold weather can get in the way of your vata - your body and mind’s energy flow. 

A mug of warm water in the mornings can even help aid digestion and promote regular bowel movements. Sipping on herbal tea over the day is also a delicious and nourishing way to hydrated, and warm.
