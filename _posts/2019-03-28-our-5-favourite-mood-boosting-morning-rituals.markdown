If shorter days and less sunlight tend to leave you feeling flat, why not start your day with some of our favourite mood-boosting morning rituals? 

Your body will feel the benefits too, because everything is connected. 

**Make yourself a cuppa**

Because positivi-tea! From boiling and brewing to stirring and sipping, making tea can serve as your very own at-home mindfulness ritual. 

We love green and black tea because they give you some caffeine - but in a gentler dose than coffee for a gentler wake-me-up, without the latte jitters. They are also both naturally rich in a compound called L-theanine, which has the potential to help calm an anxious mind. 

**Set your intentions for the day**

Simply writing down two or three things you’d like to achieve over the course of the day ahead will set the tone for the day - and help make it a positive and more fulfilling one. This can be especially helpful if you’re feeling overwhelmed about all the tasks on your to-do list. 

**Try a mindful walk**

Whether it’s around the corner or along the beach (whatever you have time for!), anything from a stroll to a brisk walk in the fresh air will get your blood flowing and those feel-good endorphins flowing. While you’re at it, why not try this mindful walking exercise: look around you and acknowledge: 

* Three things you can see,
* three things you can smell and
* three things you can hear

...A nice way to be in the present, to get out of your head and to stop and smell the roses. 
 
**Have a nourishing breakfast**

Low blood sugar and a low mood can go hand-in-hand - so this is your gentle reminder to not skip the most important meal of the day! Even if you don’t feel like eating first thing, make sure you take something nourishing with you to prevent those tummy grumbles/light-headedness/hanger later in the morning. 

Carbohydrates are your brain’s preferred form of energy, so it’s worth including a quality plant-based carbohydrate source like fibre-rich oats or banana with your breakfast - along with some protein and wholesome fats for a balanced start to the day. 

Try a Soulara Chia Pudding, porridge with berries and almond butter, or a smoothie with banana, almond milk, ground flaxseed and your favourite plant-based protein powder if you’re on the go. If you prefer savoury, try tahini and avo on some good quality grainy, sourdough or gluten free toast...delicious adorned with tomato and cracked pepper.

**Listen to your favourite song **

This might be the easiest way to lift your mood while you’re getting ready in the morning or on your commute. Why not put together a list of your favourite feel-good songs to have on the ready for beginning your day on a fresh, positive note?
