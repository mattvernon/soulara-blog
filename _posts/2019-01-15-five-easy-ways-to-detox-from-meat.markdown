Feeling a bit blah post the Australia Day sausage sizzle? We feel you.

If you’d like to take a bit of a break from meat, here are some simple ways to cut back on it successfully, and get your energetic, vibrant self back.

**1. Go Slow And Steady**

Make small changes day by day so that your move towards less meat is a gradual rather than gung-ho one - that way you won’t shock your system and any meat cravings can be kept at bay.

A good way to start is by eating meat only once or twice a week, and and switching your portion sizes on the days you do eat meat. Say meat usually takes up the majority of your dinner plate and plant-based food like veggies and wholegrains take up only a quarter of your plate; why not flip it and reverse it?

**2. Embrace Protein-Rich Plant Food**

This is KEY because protein helps to keep your blood sugar (read: your energy levels) steady, and your appetite at bay. While it’s easy to make the mistake of not eating enough protein with a plant-based diet, getting enough protein through plant food CAN be done.

Protein-rich plant foods include:

* Tofu - look for non-GM (Genetically Modified) varieties

* Tempeh (Fermented soybeans)

* Legumes like lentils and chickpeas

* Peanut butter (we like the natural kind)

**3. Focus On Fibre**

Partly because it’s low in fibre, too much meat can really disrupt your digestion - which might explain that heartburn, lethargy or constipation you seem to get after a big steak.

Fibre is nature’s detoxifier! The insoluble fibre found in plant foods can’t be digested, passing through the digestive tract and supporting the process of elimination within less than 24 hours, helping you feel lighter. Meat on the other hand can take up to three days to move along the digestive tract and be eliminated.

**4. Take Advantage Of ‘Meaty’ Vegetables**

Mushrooms provide that meaty flavour and texture, and eggplant also has that nice meaty chew, making a mouthwatering juicy plant food alternative to a steak. Miso, tamari and soy sauce also add that deep and rich meaty dimension to a meal.

**5. Make Your Meals Insta-Worthy**

It’s true that we eat with our eyes, which explains why colourful plant food in all its shapes and sizes has become so in-vogue at top restaurants...it’s just so pretty, and way easier on the eye than a piece of meat.
