Meghan Markle is living our dream life. Recently engaged to Prince Harry, the all-around superwoman boasts a resume including humanitarian work, a modeling career, and a seven-season long stint as Rachel Zane on 'Suits.' She manages to balance work, philanthropy, and now the demands of a royal wedding — and we’re all ears about how she stays in great shape, keeps energised, and always has a smile on her face.  

**She gives her body the fuel it needs**
What you eat is one of the biggest governors of your overall health, and, for Meghan, that’s no exception. In an interview with [Best Health](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/yoga/meghan-markle-the-beauty-of-balance/), she said that she typically eats a vegan diet and thinks about how the food she chooses is going to impact her overall sense of well being. “Trying to go for coffee or things like that only end up hurting you at the end, so to get a really good natural source of energy, like a great green juice, something that gets right into your system is a nice pick-me-up,” she told Shape.com. 

**But she knows it’s about balance**
You shouldn’t have to choose between good health and a good time, as long as indulgence is in moderation. Meghan told Best Health: “Of course I’m going to have that glass of wine — it’s delicious and I enjoy it.” She’s also been open up how she’ll be more flexible with her diet on the weekends, savouring Mexican or Italian food. 

**She keeps active**
One of our favourite celebrity yogis, Meghan doesn’t use her busy schedule as an excuse to avoid hitting the mat or the ground. “Running has always been my form of moving meditation, which I relish because it allows me to get out of my head,” she told Women’s Health. “My mom was a yoga instructor so that practice is in my blood. I love an intense vinyasa class — and even better if it’s blasting hip-hop and done in a dark room with candlelight.” 

Struggling to get the motivation to exercise? Meghan knows you feel, but focuses on how revitalised she’ll be afterwards to make sure she gets her work out in. “My health, my state of mind, the feeling you have after a workout; all of those things drive me to step onto my mat or go to the gym,” she said. 

**But she appreciates time to rest**
The jet-setting future duchess’s schedule probably puts ours to shame, but her secret to staying sane is giving herself the space to unwind. “I give myself the luxury of downtime. We are all so incredibly busy and juggling so many things but I always take an hour to just decompress,” she said. “That’s all part of the investment. It’s a balance.”

While a royal engagement might not be around the corner for most of us (although that doesn’t stop us from planning our wedding at Westminster Abbey), living a healthy lifestyle should remain a priority. At [Soulara](soulara.com.au), our plant-powered meals are designed to bring you delicious, nutritious food straight to your door. We want to help you feel happy, healthy, sexy, and strong.
