We’re constantly building communities: forging ones online, ones at work, ones at our yoga class. Surrounding ourselves with like-minded people allows us to feel supported, encouraged, and engaged in what is going on around us — there are few things more inspiring than striving to make a difference with people we care about. 

However, creating a new community — or trying to expand our own — isn’t always easy. It can be daunting to put ourselves out there and step outside of our comfort zone, but the rewards are well worth the effort: we’re able to bring more good vibes, and positive changes, into the world. Here are some of our fave ways to meet new people and get involved.

1.*Hit up the Farmers Market:* You don’t have to tell us twice. Going to your farmers market allows you to support the local economy and meet with your producers so you know your food is raised as sustainably as you’d like. It’s also a great opportunity to bond with farmers, artisans, and musicians, all of whom are eager to share their love of food, crafts, and art. 

2.*Join a Community Class:* Whether it be to stretch your yoga abilities or help you master a new language, there’s nothing like picking up a new skill. Even better? You get to meet people who share your interests, which could blossom into Spanish, yoga, or book groups outside of the classroom. And, of course, you could use your newfound knowledge to give back, offering your own classes or hosting local events.

3.*Volunteer, volunteer, volunteer!:* Animal lover? Gardener? Cook? Volunteering is the perfect intersection between passion and philanthropy, letting you get involved with a variety of organizations including animal shelters, food kitchens, environmental organizations, or even retirement communities. Help out by doing everything from reading with children to passing out flyers to assisting with data entry work. If you don’t have the time, consider donating extra food, clothing, toys, or bedding to those in need.

4.*Drink Local:* We know, we know: this is a hard one. Next time you’re reaching for a Pinot, check out a local distillery or winery instead. There are a plethora of amazing bottles and brews in Australia, and by heading to your local, you’ll be supporting the community while learning more about beer and wine. Usually, these guys also host events, like festivals or tastings, so you can continue to expand your network. It doesn’t hurt that you’ll become the go-to for drink suggestions.

5.*Take Charge:* Have strong feelings about a local matter? Apply for a board position in an organization. Don’t see the group you’d like to join? Create it yourself. Your voice will likely help the people who are afraid to let theirs be heard and your efforts can help inspire, motivate, and create positive change.
