1,200 years ago, people in ancient China discovered a miracle fruit: it could be used in baths, it added citrus notes to cooking, it was bursting with antioxidants, and it was a great weapon against illness. Fast forward to today, and while it remains popular in China, Japan, and Korea, you might not have heard of yuzu. We think that should change. 

Yuzu — which is related to citrus fruits like orange, grapefruits, and lemons, but has loads more Vitamin C — has a distinct, sour flavour and is highly acidic. Rather than eaten whole, the juice, rind, and zest are often used to garnish or season different dishes, from savory sauces to desserts. People will then extract the oil to be used as an essential oil. Apply it topically, mix with a lotion, or inhale through a diffuser to get its stress-relieving, rejuvenating benefits. It’s also been associated with smoother skin, increased circulation, and a stronger immune system (check out our guides to essential oils [here](https://blog.soulara.com.au/blog/guide-to-essential-oils-part-2/) and [here](https://blog.soulara.com.au/blog/guide-to-essential-oils-part-1/).) People are so fond of the fruit’s external benefits that taking a hot yuzu bath, or a yuzuyu, is a popular Japanese tradition during the winter solstice. Yuzu is thrown into the water, releasing a citrus aroma and bringing good luck by preventing illness in the coming year. 

But yuzu is not a one-trick pony. It has a variety of mental and physical benefits that can be enjoyed whether you want to add some zest to your meals or switch up your essential oil routine. 

**It relieves inflammation:** In this day and age of integrated medicine, reducing inflammation is key in the gut health game. Fighting inflammation will make you feel better in the short-term and reduce the risk of disease in the long-term. Yuzu can be your ally thanks to its antioxidants, which combat inflammation-causing free radicals.  

**It’s your brain’s new BFF:** We love that what we eat can help power and protect our brains, and yuzu is no exception. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that giving rats yuzu extract reduced the buildup of beta amyloid proteins, which are related to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The antioxidants can also help reduce free radical damage in the brain, which can lead to neurodegeneration. 

* Watch out, Botox: When we said yuzu was a miracle fruit, we weren’t kidding. All of its Vitamin C and flavonoids are more weapons against free radicals. The problem with free radicals and your skin? They’re some of the culprits behind wrinkling and fine lines. Vitamin C also helps your body better absorb collagen, which is critical for maintaining a fresh, dewy complexion. 

And the skin benefits just don’t end: Yuzu also contains Vitamin A, which will target the bacteria in your body that cause acne, while Vitamin C helps reduce swelling so even if you do suffer a breakout, it won’t be as noticeable.
