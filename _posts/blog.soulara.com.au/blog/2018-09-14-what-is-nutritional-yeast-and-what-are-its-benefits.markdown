In recent years, nutritional yeast has become a pantry staple and a superfood in its own right but what exactly is it is?

**What is Nutritional Yeast?**
Not to be confused with live yeast or brewer’s yeast, nutritional yeast is grown from sugar cane, beet molasses, or wood pulp and forms part of the fungi family.

**How it's made:**
Nutritional yeast is formed via a natural fermentation process, before its harvested and then dried, resulting in a yellow and flaky appearance, not unlike parmesan cheese. Since it’s made from a substance that generally doesn’t have much nutritional value, nutritional yeast forms its own amino acids and is packed with B vitamins, minerals, protein, and probiotics.
