At least once in our health and fitness journey, many plant-based foodies have become enamored with the trend of using green juices as a staple in our nutrition. Perhaps juices such as apple juice and orange juice have taken a back seat to the hype around theses green juices in the last couple of years. However, to the surprise of many, it is the freshly squeezed orange juice that is now making a comeback into the plant-based diet. 

The many myths that have surrounded this sweet beverage are now being cracked, to reveal the incredible gut health and digestion benefits that orange juice promotes. 

Let’s take a look at some of the benefits that this orange beverage boasts.

**Too much sugar?** 	
It seems that one of the most talked-about myths regarding orange juice, is that it contains far too much sugar to be enjoyed regularly. Despite the many claims that orange juice will result in spikes in your blood sugar levels, orange juice actually ranks low on the glycemic index. 

Well, this sounds great for orange juice lovers, but what exactly is the glycemic index? Basically, the GI is a ranking of carbohydrates according to how they raise blood sugar level. Many people believe that orange juice, along with many other beloved fruits, is high in GI, and therefore should be limited in consumption. 

The good news is that this is actually quite the opposite! Orange juice and other fruits are actually ranked quite low on the GI scale and many breads, muffins, pastas, and cereals are very high on the scale. What does this mean for those who may have a sweet tooth for orange juice? By incorporating more orange juice into your diet and cutting back on high GI products, you may promote weight loss and will be increasing your overall health!

**Promotes Gut Health and Digestion:** 

It is coming to the attention of more and more people that orange juice is a fabulous promoter of gut health and healthy digestion, due to its source of fiber. In fact, in one large orange, you will find around 18% of the daily recommended intake of fiber. The fibers that this delicious fruit boasts promotes beneficial digestion and gut health. Fibers are relatively famous for encouraging a healthy digestive system, so by enjoying a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, your gut health will be sure to thank you!

**Contains Natural Acids**: If you are experiencing poor digestion, your body may be in need of naturally lowering its stomach pH, which is something that orange juice thrives in with its citric and ascorbic acids! According to “Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism”, freshly squeezed orange juice can have a pH lower than 3. This means that by drinking fresh orange juice before your next meal, you will lower your stomach pH levels and encourage a healthy and functional digestive system. 

Now that we have revealed the amazing benefits of orange juice with gut health, you can enjoy this refreshing beverage, worry-free! Just be sure that your juice is of good quality and 100% fresh orange juice, which you will find in Soulara's Cold Pressed Sunshine Booster, so that you can reap the impressive benefits of this popular fruit!
