An apple a day keeps the doctor away — but the reliable apple isn’t the only one that can keep your health goals on track. The world of fruit is a varied one with a wealth of different flavours, vitamins, and benefits that are crucial for our wellbeing. Unfortunately, ABC reports that four in five Australians are not eating sufficient amounts of fruits or vegetables, meaning they’re missing out on opportunities to charge their bodies with much-needed nutrients. Make sure you’re meeting your daily quota with these super-powered fruits, as healthy as they are delicious.

**Acai Berry:** The king of antioxidants, acai berries have more antioxidants than other popular sources like blueberries, strawberries and pomegranates. The healthy substances help protect your body from free radicals, molecules that are created when your body breaks down food or is exposed to environmental toxins like tobacco smoke or radiation. Acai berries also contain fiber and heart-healthy fats.

However, like all fruits, acai berries can be very high in sugar. If you’re about to dive into an acai bowl, check out our tips on [how to make healthy smoothies](https://blog.soulara.com.au/blog/how-to-make-a-balanced-smoothie/) — make sure each serving of fruit is countered by a serving of veggies, and there are no added sweeteners. 

**Guava:** Beauty may come from the inside, but munching on some guava will ensure it’s on the outside, too. Guava is loaded with vitamin C, which is a major player in collagen production. That means fewer wrinkles and glowing skin, all wrapped up in the package of a tasty fruit that’s great on its own or tossed into a smoothie. Guava also helps fight bacteria, and can defend your body from foodborne pathogens. 

**Papaya:** Otherwise known as pawpaw, this fluorescent orange superstar has a long history of being treated as a health tonic. Offering anti-inflammatory benefits — which helps defend against multiple health disorders and diseases — the mighty papaya contains the phytonutrient lycopene and the enzyme papain. The combination of the two will boost your body with antioxidants while allowing you to digest proteins more easily.  Lycopene has been shown to ward off certain types of cancers, while, when applied topically, papain has been shown to help facilitate healing.

**Avocado:** C’mon. It’s Australia. We couldn’t make a list about fruit without mentioning the mighty (and beloved) avocado. There are few meals it doesn’t go with, and there are few things it doesn’t do. Boasting Omega’s 3, 6, and 9 and vitamin E, all of its healthy fats make it an incredible tool for stimulating your brain, protecting your liver, lowering bad cholesterol, and even maintaining a healthy weight. Sounds like the perfect excuse to go out for a smashed avo now, doesn’t it? 

**Runner-ups:** Still looking for new ways to mix up your fruit game? We’re also currently obsessed with goji berries, Camu Camu, and lychee. The whole berry family is, of course, a go-to.
