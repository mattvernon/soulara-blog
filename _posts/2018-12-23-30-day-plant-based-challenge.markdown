If you’ve been considering going plant-based, now is the perfect time. We’re running a **30 day plant-based challenge** to give your body a chance to reap all the benefits of living a plant-powered lifestyle. Plant-powered doesn’t just mean vegan. Vegan refers to no-animal products which means you could live off potato chips and muesli bars and still be vegan. Whereas, plant-based means no animal products, but also no processed foods. Processed foods are full of empty calories, with very little to no nutritional value, and yet they make up a huge part of the average Aussie’s diet.

By going plant-powered, you are choosing to eat whole foods, and give your body the foods it needs for optimised health and wellness.

So what are the benefits?

**[Heart health](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322072.php)**
Studies have found that eating a plant-based diet helps reduce plaque build-up in the arteries and can significantly reduce your chance of heart related diseases. Plant-based foods contain no cholesterol so by switching to a plant-based diet you can also reduce your cholesterol as well as lowering your blood sugar levels.

**[Prebiotic Fibre](https://drjockers.com/top-33-prebiotic-foods/)**
Plant-based foods like garlic, onions, carrots, chicory root and bananas are high is prebiotic fibre. You need food that is high in fibre to have a healthy gut and a healthy digestive system. Prebiotic fibre helps reduce inflammation, boosts the immune system and guards against obesity.

Being in a healthy weight range is 70% diet related, so what you eat plays a major part in your weight and Body Mass Index. Plant-based diets are low in calories, low in sugar and very high in nutrients, which means your body is digesting better, your metabolism is functioning at its best and you’re not eating foods that simply turn straight into fat. So, in turn you are likely to shed any extra kilos that are keeping you above a healthy weight range.

**[More energy](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-25054/im-a-registered-dietitian-heres-what-people-get-wrong-about-a-plantbased-diet.html)**
Getting a “food coma” after a big meal isn’t a normal reaction, it’s a big indicator that you’ve just eaten the wrong foods. Food is fuel, it should give you energy, if what you’ve eaten makes you want to nap - you body is telling you that it can’t function with that kind of food as fuel. Plant-based meals are so rich in nutrients and essential vitamins that you will find yourself feeling more energetic and more alert after every meal.

Plant-based diets are sustainable and support ecosystems rather than destroy them. By switching to a plant-based diet you are reducing your carbon footprint, protecting the lives and wellbeing of animals, and saving forests from deforestation. A plant-powered lifestyle is eating and living as nature intended.
