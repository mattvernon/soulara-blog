In the 21st century, sometimes meditation, mindful eating, and deep breathing just aren’t enough to reduce stress. We understand, and we’re here for you. Allow us to introduce our daily saviours – adaptogens.

Adaptogenic herbs have been used in Indian Ayurvedic and Chinese herbal medicine for centuries. These magical little herbs are non-toxic and assist the body in healing and responding to different environments. Unlike conventional medicines or non-adaptogenic herbs, adaptogens don’t interfere with the body’s natural mechanisms, and instead assist in regulating and ‘adapting’ the body’s natural processes.

Here are our Soulara approved adaptogens for reducing your stress and boosting your mood!

**Rhodiola**

During times of stress, rhodiola helps balance the body’s cortisol (stress hormone) secretion. Rhodiola also aids in improving mood, increasing energy, and can promote better concentration in people with adrenal fatigue.

Rhodiola is quite strong, so avoid taking it in the evening if you’re sensitive to herbs!

Try mixing rhodiola powder into your smoothies or warm milk, or take the tincture in a small glass of warm water.

**Licorice root**

Aside from being delicious, this sweet herb helps regulate stress-related hormone levels (including cortisol) which allows your adrenal system to take a break.

Try licorice root steeped as a tea.

**Ginseng**

Ginseng has the ability to delay our body’s stress response, which helps reduce symptoms of anxiety. It also works to improve mood and concentration, increase energy, and improve sexual function (yay!).

Try ginseng as a tincture in warm water, or steeped as a tea.

**Tulsi/holy basil**

Tulsi has long been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of conditions including skin diseases, infections, and coughs. However it also has amazing adaptogenic properties, with its phytochemical compounds helping to lower blood corticosterone (a stress hormone) and have a positive impact on the brain’s neurotransmitter system.

Try tulsi steeped as a tea.

**Reishi mushroom**

Reishi is a brain tonic and can help enhance concentration and support mood. It also helps the body’s stress response and supports the immune system.

Try reishi mushroom as a powder added to smoothies or hot chocolate, or in Soulara’s delicious [Reishi Cacao Bliss Bites!](https://www.soulara.com.au/on-the-menu)
