There are two types of guts in the world: those in symbiosis, or where everything is balanced both internally and with the rest of the body, and those in dysbiosis, or where things are, well, not-so-balanced. In an ideal situation, our guts would have the perfect ratio of good to bad bacteria and would thus be able to produce essential amino acids, vitamins, and even neurotransmitters like serotonin, which is responsible for you feeling happy. 

However, it’s not uncommon for our guts to get thrown out of whack. Poor diets, stress, toxins within our environments, and medication use can allow the bad bacteria to take over, opening the door for everything from allergies to cancer to inflammatory bowel disease, and leaving you with unpleasant symptoms like bloating, gas, anxiety, brain fog, or skin conditions. (Let us help you figure out if your gut might need some TLC.) 

But your body wants to be healthy, and making some lifestyle changes can help it heal more quickly — and help you feel like your best self. 

**Get Vibrant with Veggies**
[We’re obsessed with plant-based diets](https://www.soulara.com.au/on-the-menu), especially because they’re your first, and best, weapon when getting your gut health on track. Rich in fiber and essential vitamins and minerals, they help facilitate digestion, nourish all your systems, and create an environment where good bacteria can flourish.

**Reach for Supplements**
A great way to boost gut health is through probiotics, which help replenish your gut flora. However, also consider using digestive enzymes for a short period of time and taking marshmallow root, which can help repair a damaged gut lining. Adaptogens like ashwagandha, Holy Basil, and rhodiola can indirectly assist you by reducing cortisol levels and bodily inflammation.

**Say No to Antibiotics**
In the right situation, antibiotics can be a necessary cure — but those situations are a lot more rare than the current number of antibiotic subscriptions would suggest. While antibiotics eliminate the bad bacteria in your gut, they don’t discriminate between the bugs and often kill off the good bacteria, too, disrupting the entire ecosystem. It can be a difficult, and lengthy, process for your gut to restore the lost flora.

**Practice Self-Love**
We know that it can be hard to slow down when we have so many things we want to accomplish, but taking time to relax is crucial for your health. When we’re stressed, our body releases a hormone called cortisol, which [can cause inflammation throughout your body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592668/), particularly in your gut, which creates an environment hostile to good bacteria. Develop habits that help you disconnect, like meditation, yoga, or even just an uninterrupted Netflix sesh.

Your quality time with your bed is also an important component of self-care. Make sure you’re getting sufficient amounts of sleep each night as well — between seven and nine is recommended — and you should crawl under the covers consistently throughout the week. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417104) have shown that improper sleep can hurt your gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis.  

**Get Moving**
Need to boost your good gut bacteria? Hit the gym, jog around your neighborhood, or step onto your yoga mat. New studies have shown that [regular exercise helps the development of beneficial bacteria](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/well/move/exercise-microbiome-health-weight-gut-bacteria.html) while also helping your body self-clean. We’re talking about the natural detox your body does to maintain optimal wellness: when you work out, your body starts to damage muscles and recycle old cells for long-term benefits like greater resistance to inflammation and a slowed aging process.
