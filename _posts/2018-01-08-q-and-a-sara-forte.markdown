Sara Forte has made a name for herself in the health food industry, but that doesn’t mean she believes brownies are off-limits. The founder of blog [Sprouted Kitchen](https://www.sproutedkitchen.com) and [cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Sara-Forte/e/B008DI1QNQ/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) author (she’s working on her third) strives to help people unlock the power and potential of real foods with delicious recipes photographed by hubby [Hugh](http://hughforte.com). We chatted with the veggie-loving blogger about why it’s okay to indulge, how to stay healthy while slammed at work, and her dream dinner guests. 

**Tell us a bit about your journey. How long have you been creating healthy recipes?** 
A few years into college, I started working at the organic farm on campus and that whole experience changed what "healthy food" was for me. I was paid in produce, so I taught myself how to use them by way of reading recipes and watching Food Network. I messed up a lot but I learned. I worked for restaurants and caterers. All of these experiences contributed to my knowledge of food and hospitality. It has intrigued me for both its wellness and care-taking aspects. My goal is to share recipes for practical, produce-focused home cooking. 

**What does a healthy diet mean to you?** 
I absolutely think it is different per person. What we put into our bodies affects its performance — mentally and physically. I try to keep things like wheat to a minimum but by no means off limits. I love a good thin crust pizza and a brownie a la mode. I think it's as simple as being mindful of what you're doing, what goes in your mouth, paying attention to what sits in your gut after you eat it. I think a healthy diet is not one that controls you, but allows you to feel good and well with the nutrition it fills your beautiful body with.

**How does your diet help you feel better, mentally and physically?**
As an obvious statement: eating better makes me feel better physically. I have more energy, sleep better, am happier because I feel healthy in my guts. I don't get this right all the time. All of our choices compound on each other and create good habits. I don't think a good life begins and ends with your diet, but I absolutely think it is worth stepping back and seeing the holes where you are possibly self-sabotaging because of it.

**Healthy nutrition tips for busy people?**
*Prep food in advance. Make a couple dressings/sauces so you can easily throw together a big green salad or bowl of quinoa.
*Keep a well-stocked pantry so the burden of going to the store constantly doesn't deter you from a wholesome meal. 
*Find a few resources to inspire you to try new recipes. 

**Biggest misconception about healthy eating?**
I think people see it as a set of rules, do and don'ts, things you're "not allowed" to eat. I live within a pretty moderate view of eating "healthy," where there is no black and white. I eat a delicious pasta dish but it'll be small and my salad three times the volume. I don't think healthy eating is never eating delicious foods that make you happy, it's eating less of them, being moderate. 

**If you could cook any meal for anyone, alive or dead, who would it be, and what would you cook?**
I would love to sit at a table of women I admire - Oprah, Michelle Obama, Harriet Tubman, Alice Waters. I would make them a Mediterranean-type feast with falafels and salad and grilled eggplant and hummus. That is my favorite meal for sharing.  

**Current favorite recipe?**
I have been working on a double chocolate cookie recipe for my next cookbook made with coconut oil and almond flour and they are just so, so good.
