How long have we been searching for the fountain of youth? Long enough that beauty companies have learned slapping promises of age-resistant, wrinkle-free skin on creams and lotions is the perfect way to lure us in. And while a good skincare regime should be celebrated, a lot of how you look (and feel) is about how you take care of yourself physically and emotionally. A youthful appearance doesn’t have to be bought at a makeup counter, but can be obtained through a healthy, plant-based diet and a little TLC.

Besides — we think aging should be celebrated. With more years, and even hours, under our belt, we become more confident, compassionate, self-aware individuals, able to be better friends, partners, and family while finding our own positive way to [give back to the world](https://blog.soulara.com.au/blog/how-to-become-more-involved-in-your-community/). 

Ginger Tea
Popular with women in India, this is a simple addition to your morning routine. Brew some hot water, let fresh, sliced ginger steep for 10 minutes, and add honey. Honey, especially a local variety, is anti-bacterial and reduces inflammation. Ginger contains a powerful antioxidant called gingerol, which helps with collagen production. Collagen, the most abundant protein in our bodies, keeps skin elastic and supple.

Sugar Scrub
Like we said, a good skincare regimen should be celebrated. Once or twice a week, use a natural, homemade exfoliator sugar scrub to remove dead skin and brighten up your appearance. The older we get, the harder it can be for our bodies to naturally exfoliate, but exfoliated skin allows us to better absorb moisturizers. 

In Mexico, a popular combination is sugar and lemon juice, as lemon continues alpha hydroxyl acid. This is found in many of the popular anti-aging treatments, although we promise it’s a lot more affordable in the produce section. A sugar and coconut oil combination is a great moisturizer, and coconut oil’s antibacterial and anti-fungal properties can help clear skin.

Monitor Stress
We know you know this: stress equals bad. But do you know exactly why it has such a harmful impact on your health? Chronic stress damages your DNA by shortening the strands, or telomeres. This makes you age faster and causes inflammation. Luckily, a healthy diet, meditation, and exercise can help lengthen them.  

Eat More Fruits & Veggies
Maybe we’re a bit biased, but we love learning that something we’re doing anyways is great for our health. You don’t have time to read the nearly endless list of what makes fruits and veggies so great for your skin, so we’ll just jump to our favourites. They’re naturally hydrating and contain a variety of skin-friendly minerals and vitamins.

By eating a plant-based diet, you’re also avoiding processed and sugary foods, which cause inflammation and have been shown to accelerate the aging process. Those foods wreck havoc on your gut, while plant-based foods will keep it healthy — a healthy gut means healthy collagen production.
