People have been turning to herbs for health and medicine for thousands of years.  Although we live in a world dominated by pharmaceutical companies, most of us are still connected to our herbal roots in one way or another.

Sage is usually known for its cleansing spaces and balancing energies, however this wonder-herb does so much more.

**Brain Booster**

In latin, Sage (Salvia officinalis) means ‘to heal’. Sage has been the highlight of ancient proverbs and sayings for centuries, and for good reason. According to Adrian L. Lopresti, School of Psychology and Exercise Science, Murdoch University, ”Salvia plants are traditionally noted for their antioxidant effects and ability to enhance ‘head and brain’ function, improve memory, quicken the senses, and delay age-associated cognitive decline”. They are huge benefits, from one little herb.

**How It Works Its Magic**

The sage plant is a rich source of polyphenol compounds which fight against pathogens and diseases in the brain and body.  With 160 identified polyphenols, sage is effective in enhancing cognitive activity and keeping your brain healthy. This means that by consuming sage, you are slowing down your neural ageing and warding off diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

**The Research**

There has been new and extensive research on how sage improves memory. Studies coming out of the Medicinal Plant Research Centre (MPRC) at the Universities of Newcastle and Northumbria are proving the memory-enhancing effects of sage. In one study, 44 healthy adults aged between 18 and 37 were given either a capsule of sage oil or a placebo. They were then given a list of words to remember. The group that were given the sage oil consistently remembered more words than those given the placebo.

This study has led to studies about how this wonder-herb could potentially assist people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease that affects memory and mental function.  A person with Alzheimer’s will have a build-up of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. It is believed to be one of the causes of the neural disease.  In a study with mice, Salvia is said to protect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. When the mice were ingesting sage, they were protected against the accumulation of this peptide on the brain. This kind of study could lead to breakthrough cures for Alzheimer’s disease.

Sage, is most beneficial as a preventative against disease, rather than a treatment. Some of the recorded benefits of Sage include enhancements in secondary memory, attention, word recall and speed of memory. Mood enhancing effects such as alertness, calmness and contentedness are also effects of the Salvia plant.

**How To Add More Sage To Your Life**

There are so many ways to consume this wonder-herb.

**Tincture:** A potent alcohol-based form of infusion where the herb is soaked in high-proof alcohol for 14 days or more. And then taken as drops.

**Tea/Water infusion:** Similar to the tincture, the infusion is brewed in hot water in a covered container for a minimum time of 15 minutes but up to 24 hours for a strong infusion.

**Smell: **The effects of many herbs can often be brought on simply smelling them. In this case, smelling sage essential oil is calming and relaxing.
