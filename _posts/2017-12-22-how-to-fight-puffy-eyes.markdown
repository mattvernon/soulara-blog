We recently covered what causes puffy eyes, but while understanding the underlying reasons is critical for improving appearance over time, sometimes we just need a quick fix. Here are some of our go-to methods to lighten, brighten, and tighten while we’re on the go:

Cucumber slices: It’s a staple for a reason — and it’s dermatologist approved. Channel some serious spa vibes in your living room by placing slices of the antioxidant and flavonoid-rich fruit over your eyes. The substances are naturally anti-inflammatory, while the coolness will help alleviate any extra swelling.

Brew some tea: It might sound like something your grandma would recommend, but brewing and then chilling chamomile, green, or black tea before placing them on your eyes for 10-15 minutes can help treat some late-night puffiness. 

Give yourself a massage: No, don’t go get a massage (although we’re big fans of that idea, too). Gently massage the area around your puffy eyes to help encourage lymphatic drainage. Often, inflammation is caused by a build-up of fluid, so stimulating the area can be more effective than just slapping on some under-eye cream. Getting some exercise can accomplish the same thing, so hit the mat or go for a jog for a refreshed complexion. Inverted yoga poses can be a great way to increase circulation in the face and reduce swelling. 

Skip the salt: Salt is a big perpetrator of fluid retention, directly contributing to tired-looking eyes. Stay aware of how much salt is in what you’re eating — processed foods, pizza, and sandwiches can be high in sodium (and curbing these foods is better for your healthy anyways). If you’re dealing with serious salt cravings, use a small amount of pure Himalayan sea salt, which has been proven to do everything from improve respiratory problems to balance the body’s pH. 

Chill some spoons: If you’re running low on produce, turn to your silverware drawer. Pop a spoon or two in the freezer until the metal is nice and cool, and then rest against your eyes. The coolness will tighten the skin and constrict blood vessels to reduce the puffiness. 

Remove your makeup: We’re always told to make sure we’ve removed our makeup before bed, but that’s not just to prevent breakouts. Leaving on eye makeup can be extremely irritating, causing the skin to get puffy. 

Go nuts with a neti pot: Resembling a small teapot, neti pots have been used in Ayurvedic medicine to flush out moisture in your sinuses related to colds or allergies. You’ll flush out the water and mucus buildup and clear your entire sinus passage. Using it is easy: you pour salt water into one nostril and it drains out the other side. It can feel weird at first, but trust us: you’ll get used to it, and, more importantly, you’ll love the results.
