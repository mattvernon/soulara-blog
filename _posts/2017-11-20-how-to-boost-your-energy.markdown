We know that you have big goals — and that a lot of energy is needed to accomplish them. Luckily, staying perky isn’t just a matter of knocking back an almond latte every couple of hours. Our body wants to keep us naturally boosted — but sometimes, it just needs a little help from us. As you most likely know, your gut plays a prominent role in how you feel mentally and physically. What we eat, and how we metabolise it, gives us energy, though you don’t want to neglect the rest of your body. Here are some of our other favourite tricks to care for the whole self to leave you feeling ready to conquer the day.

**Pop some probiotics**
We love that probiotics are becoming more mainstream. They are essential for making sure your gut is populated with good bacteria, which will help you feel more focused and keep your digestion system working properly.  Coconut yogurt, sauerkraut, kombucha, or probiotic pills are all great sources. Your diet should primarily consist of fruits and vegetables, limiting refined or sugary foods that can damage your gut health.

**Fight fatigue**
Given the hustle and stress of our day-to-day lives, sleep — or even just relaxation — can take a backseat to our to-do list. However, prolonged periods of exhaustion can drain your adrenals. Too much strain on them can lead to adrenal fatigue, or the feeling of being deeply fatigued all the time with symptoms including the constant urge to sleep, not feeling rested, cravings for sugary foods, or a loss of appetite. Care for your adrenals by limiting your caffeine — try to stick to just one coffee a day, and resist having one after 3 PM. Aim to get a full eight hours and be in bed around 10 PM. Commit to regular breathing exercises, and make sure your diet is packed with nutritious foods. 

**Don’t force your workout**
It never hurts to be reminded that every body is different, and while staying active is an integral component of a healthy lifestyle, don’t adopt an exercise routine just because your friend does. Choose what works best for you, and what brings you the greatest sense of pleasure and accomplishment. Yoga? HIIT workouts? Running, or a few rounds on the tennis court? By doing what you enjoy, you’ll be giving your body what it specifically needs.

**Test your thyroid**
Low energy can be the result of a hypoactive thyroid. Consult a doctor to test your thyroid’s functions and before embarking on a supplement binge. Maca, chlorophyll, brazil nuts, and sea vegetables can be great ways to restore thyroid health, but are also great additions to any diet. B vitamins also help support thyroid function — sluggishness could indicate a B12 deficiency, but reach out to a medical expert before self-diagnosing.
