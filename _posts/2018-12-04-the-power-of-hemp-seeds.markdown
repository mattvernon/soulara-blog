Hemps seeds may be small but they are the superfood fairydust you should be sprinkling on everything from breakfast to dessert. Hemp foods have only recently been legalised for consumption in Australia so it has never been easier to get your hands on some hemp-protein goodness.

### **What are hemp seeds?**

Hemp seeds come from the Cannabis sativa plant however they don’t contain any THC (the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis) so they won’t make you high, and won’t come up in any drug tests. Instead, they do wonders for your health and wellbeing -  especially for your brain.

### **High in protein**

Hemp seeds are an excellent source of plant-based protein. For every tablespoon on hemp seeds, there are about 9 grams of protein. So that means a couple of tablespoons of hemp seeds is nearly half the RDI of protein for the average woman.

Being a complete source of protein, they contain all nine essential amino acids which make them the boss of all plant-based proteins.

### **Good fat guru**

Loaded with unsaturated fats, hemp seeds contain the perfect ratio of omega 6 and omega 3 essential fatty acids , which is 2:1. Most of us consume too much omega 6 and not enough omega 3 which is why this ratio is so important because it provides the perfect amount of both. Having such great omega content, hemp seeds are the perfect brain food.

### **Hemp on the brain**

Hemp seeds are packed with cognitive-supporting antioxidants and minerals which make them an essential ingredient in all things brain-health.

GLA (gamma linoleic acid) is a part of the omega-6 family but derives from plants. This super-healing strand of omega-6 is found in hemp seeds. GLA remedies inflammation around the body, especially inflammation that occurs in the brain, with depression, hormonal imbalances and menopause. It also protects against autoimmune diseases and balances the metabolism.

### **How to get more hemp on your plate**

Hemp has a very low burning point so it is best consumed raw. You can eat them as seeds or in hemp seed oil (which also doubles as a great skin moisturiser).

**In your smoothie:** A tablespoon in your smoothie will go completely unnoticed (so why not add 2?)

**On your yoghurt or muesli:** In fact, sprinkle them on any type of brekkie or snack.

**On toast or in your sandwich:** Hemp seeds make a great topping on your toast and can be added with the filling in any sandwich.

**Salad Dressing:** Add hemp seeds to your salad dressing, either blended in a processor or whole.

**Boost your desserts:** Sprinkle hemp seeds on your cakes, puddings and even your ice cream!
