If you want to feel your best, quality shut-eye is as important as a wholesome diet and moving your body each day...something you’ll be very aware of if unhealthy sleep habits have crept up on you. 

Rejuvenate your body and mind with our top tips for improving your sleep quality. 

**1. Eat some cherries**

They’re naturally rich in the sleep hormone melatonin. If you’ve been struggling to fall asleep at night, try a handful of cherries, or some cherry juice from the health food store a couple of hours before bed. 

Dimming the lights in the lead up to bedtime can also enhance the brain’s production of melatonin. 

**2. Switch off from smart devices**

Your smartphone and social media are highly stimulating - and all that mindless scrolling be why you feel like you can’t stop your mind from ticking once your head hits the pillow. 

Why not give yourself a smart device ‘curfew’, putting your phone away for the evening come 8pm. It’s also worth not going to bed with your phone next to you - to avoid that tempting late night/early morning scroll through social from bed! 

**3. Create a nurturing bedtime routine**

One that encourages your body and mind to wind down. Work towards making a habit of doing something every night (or most nights) of the week that helps quieten your mind. That might be curling up with a book, having a hot bath, meditating, or doing some restorative yoga - like lying with your legs up the wall for 10 minutes to calm your nervous system...try it!

**4. Sip chamomile tea**

This floral herbal tea is rich in the antioxidant apigenin, which can bring on feelings of sleepiness. We’ll drink to that! 

**5. Be conscious of coffee**

If you’re an afternoon coffee drinker, switch your latte for something just as yummy that won’t leave you feeling wired. Dandelion tea makes a delicious coffee alternative, or try one of our uplifting [Kombuchas](https://www.soulara.com.au/on-the-menu). 

**6. Remember to exercise**

Getting your blood flowing during the day will help set your body up for rest. Movement also encourages the release of ‘feel-good’ endorphins, reducing any stress, anger or anxiety that you’re holding onto - and which might be getting in the way of those sweet dreams.
